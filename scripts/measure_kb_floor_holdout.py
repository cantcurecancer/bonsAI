"""Title: Knowledge-base floor measurement, held-back rows

Purpose: Judge the "none of these fit" floor on the rows the lane that built it was not allowed
         to see -- the 41 held-back troubleshooting rows of tests/fixtures/kb_eval_v2.json, the
         24 blind problem sentences inside them, a set of junk phrases, and the four device
         sentences that caught the notes hole on 2026-09-07.
Used for: Plan 48 section 7, the tips and notes table the retire-or-keep and ship-or-stop calls
          are written from. Run by the one running the session, never by a lane -- reading these
          rows is what the lane's blindness rule forbids.
Solves: The lane reports its own tuning-row table, which cannot say whether a floor generalises.
        Before this, "wrong tips attached went down" was only ever measured on rows the tuner
        could see, which is the failure mode plan 47's tip lane was built to avoid.
Does not: Change any threshold, edit the service, write a report into docs/, or touch the Deck.
          It reads the corpus and prints a table.

Run on the maintainer PC with Ollama up and a built corpus:
