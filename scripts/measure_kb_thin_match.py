"""Title: Knowledge-base thin-match measurement

Purpose: Find out whether a note that DID attach can be told apart from one that attached only
         because something in the corpus scored well by accident -- so the "not in my notes"
         line can key off how good the match was instead of only off whether anything attached.
Used for: The maintainer's 2026-09-07 call, "change what the line keys off". Run before the
          line is changed, so the rule that ships is the one the numbers picked.
Solves: The line today shows only when nothing attached, and something nearly always attaches,
         so it almost never shows. Raising the attach floor high enough to fix that costs
         twenty or more correct notes (see STRATEGY_MEANING_FLOOR's comment). This measures the
         other route: leave the note attached and say the match was thin.
Does not: Change any threshold, edit the service, or touch the Deck. It reads the corpus and
          prints tables.

Two candidate signals are measured, because the floor comment already rules out the obvious one
on its own -- two of the four device sentences score 0.6349 and 0.6369, inside the range of
genuinely right notes:

  meaning     the strongest cosine in the candidate pool (KnowledgeRetrievalResult.best_meaning)
  keyword     whether the winning card was ranked by the keyword search at all, or was found by
              meaning alone (KnowledgeRetrievalResult.top_card_keyword_score == 0)

For each rule the table reports the two numbers that decide it: how many rows that got their
RIGHT note would be warned about anyway (the cost, a false alarm on a good answer), and how many
rows that got a WRONG note would be warned about (the win).

Run on the maintainer PC with Ollama up and a built corpus:
