# Title: Windows deploy script (remote Steam Deck)
# Purpose: Build the frontend + seed KB and deploy them to a Deck over SSH.
# Used for: `.\scripts\build.ps1` and, by inheritance, `.\scripts\watch-deploy.ps1`.
# Solves: The Windows equivalent of `build.sh dev` - prune, copy, verify, restart.
# Does not: Deploy locally (use `build.sh local`) or build a release zip.
#
# ASCII only, deliberately. This file has no BOM, so Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads it as
# CP1252: a UTF-8 em-dash inside a double-quoted string decodes to a smart quote, which
# PowerShell accepts as a string delimiter and the whole script stops parsing.

# Deliberately NOT $ErrorActionPreference = "Stop". Under Windows PowerShell 5.1 that turns a
# native command's stderr into a terminating NativeCommandError whenever the script's output is
# redirected (`build.ps1 2>&1 | ...`), so a harmless `pnpm`/node deprecation warning aborts the
# deploy. Failures are handled explicitly instead: every ssh/scp is checked by Assert-LastExit,
# and the cmdlets whose failure would corrupt the run carry their own -ErrorAction Stop.

# Load connection details from .env (credentials are never stored in this script)
