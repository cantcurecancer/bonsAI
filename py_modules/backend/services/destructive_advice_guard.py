"""Title: Destructive mod/save advice guard

Purpose: Output-side check that flags a finished Ollama reply advising the user to delete
save data, a Wine/Proton prefix, or compatdata, without a backup step anywhere in the same
reply.
Used for: Post-generation safety pass in run_game_ai_request (game_ai_request.py), run once
the full reply text is available.
Solves: docs/planning/12-deep-mod-ai-hints-feasibility.md Section 5.3 -- there was no
output-side check on destructive advice. The only existing mitigation is a prompt instruction
at ollama_prompts.py:926 ("Auto-clarity: for irreversible or destructive warnings..."), which is
input-side only: a model that ignores it produces unflagged destructive advice.
Does not: Block, truncate, or rewrite the model's text -- it only appends a visible safety
notice when the check fires, so a reply that is otherwise useful still reaches the user. Does
not run per-token against the live stream; token streaming (ollama_ask_service.py's on_delta
callback) publishes partial text to the UI before this module ever sees the reply, so on a
streamed Ask the raw text is already visible before the notice can be appended. Catching that
would mean scanning partial, still-growing text turn by turn and deciding when to abort a
stream mid-generation -- a materially bigger change than one output-side check, and out of
scope here. See the module-level test file for the false-positive cases this is tuned against.

Known misses, kept honest because this is a safety check and an overstated one is worse than
none. It is keyword matching, not comprehension: a reply that describes the deletion without
naming the folder ("just start it fresh and let Steam rebuild everything"), or that names a
target several clauses away from the verb, still gets through. `format` is deliberately not
inflected -- see the comment on the verb pattern. And on a streamed Ask the raw text is on
screen before this runs at all, per the paragraph above.

# Sentence-scoped on purpose: "remove the mod" or "delete the shortcut" name no destructive
# target, so they never trip the guard even though "remove"/"delete" alone are common words.
# Both a verb and a target must land in the same sentence for a signal to count.
#
# Inflected forms are matched, not just the bare imperative. `\bdelete\b` leaves no word
# boundary before "ing", so "deleting" never matched -- and a model writing prose says
# "try deleting" far more often than "delete". Measured on device 2026-08-27: the reply
# "Try deleting the existing prefix folder and letting Steam rebuild it" reached the user
# with no notice, and this was one of its two independent reasons (DESTRUCT-ADVICE-01).
#
# `format` / `reformat` stay uninflected on purpose. "formatting" collides with the
# ordinary text sense ("the save file formatting"), and unlike the others this verb has a
# common innocent meaning, so widening it would buy a rare catch for a routine false hit.

# "prefix" on its own is the second half of the same device miss: the model names the brand
# once at the top of a reply and then just says "the prefix". But a bare "prefix" also has an
# ordinary text meaning -- "remove the bonsai- prefix from the setting name" is advice this
# very assistant could give, and flagging it would be a false alarm.
#
# So a bare "prefix" counts as a target only when the reply has already established what kind
# of prefix it is talking about. The topic word may be in any sentence; the destructive verb
# still has to share a sentence with the word "prefix", so this widens the target vocabulary
# without loosening the sentence-scoping the rest of the guard depends on.
